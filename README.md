# A little about me
* Father to two little boys(Cole & Liam) and a dog(Jack).
* Married to Tina who support whatever crazy idea I may have.
* Enjoy all kinds of sports but is not very good at them.  We can play together if you want a good laugh.
* I love traveling and taking time off to go somewhere decompress (you should do! it's healthly and will be highly supported).
* I enjoy talking to people and making connections, but I'm socially awkward so it is diffcult.  I know it doesn't make sense but sometimes things don't and it's ok.
* My grammar and spelling is a work in progress, so please forgive me but also let me know so I can address it and learn from it.

# Values/Norms/North Star/Principles (Whatever you want to call it)
#### Trust is the most important thing. 
Without trust we have nothing.   This is true for any relationship, but even your work relationships. 


#### Open communication.
If I have information, I will share it with you.  Cavet: unless the company requires that I don’t or to respect other people's wish for privacy. 

If something is bugging you, you’ll tell me. We can give each other critical feedback and we don’t take it personally. If we make a mistake, we’ll apologize.

#### Empathize with our customers. 
We make products that affect real people’s lives. Always remember that and let that guide your decision-making.

A Platform/Infrastructure is a product too.  Our customers are going to be closer to us and have more access, but our decisions will impact their lives and work.  While tackling a technical issue let that guide your decision-making.

#### Be excellent to ourselves and each other. 
Assume positive intent. If that’s not working, seek first to understand when you don’t feel sure of someone else’s intentions. That also applies to yourself — remember to be kind to yourself.


#### Always question, always ask ‘why?’. 
We can’t assume that others have all the right answers or solutions from the start. We’ll have the opportunity to amplify and multiply each other’s work when we question.

Don't be shy to ask and be curious.  Every person has a different background and perceptive and it will bring more to the conversation and solution to talk it through.  The best solution has always be a mesh of ideas from different individuals. 

#### Be brave and continuous learning. 
Work with a growth mindset, which means that we know we’re not perfect and we’re always seeking out ways to improve personally and professionally.

Don't be afraid to fail, the biggest growth is when something goes wrong and you learn from it.

Have a bias towards action.  Don't let fear hold you back from doing your best.  In some cases long discussion is warranted, but most of the time it's best to act and learn. 

#### We are all leaders/owners.
Leadership can come from anywhere.  Remember no one is the best at everything.  Push for what you believe in and drive it fully.

# How can we help each other?
#### Provide context: 
My day is spent collecting, filtering and sharing information across teams, projects and domains. I’ll try to push information to you as much as possible but feel free to ask about anything.

Your day is spent working with the systems, team memebers and other teams.  Push the necessary context back up so we will be on the same page.  Part of my job is ensuring you’re doing the best and that you’re set up for success. I won’t know what you don’t tell me, so allow me to help if necessary.

#### Give you another perspective: 
I may or may not  be working on your project day to day but I’ll be close enough to share an informed opinion.

You will be working on the project and will be able to provide a perspective on how the team and system is functioning.


#### We feel safe debating with each other or anyone on the team. 
The best ideas come from a diverse set of opinions. I hope that you always speak up, and let me know your thoughts on any subject or problem.  I will ensure that your voice and ideas are heard.
 

#### Prioritize: 
We are partners in deciding priorties.  However, I can help you prioritize or deprioritize work if you are unsure. I’ll help you think through the options.

#### Cheerlead: 
I’ll champion your work, share your success, and recognize you across various teams in the organization. 

You will champion your team and teammates work and share their success.  Recognize your team memebers for not only what they help you with but the amazing work they are doing.

#### Firefight: 
Nothing is ever perfect. Mistakes can and will happen, and I’ll be there to help overcome, whether it can be resolved within our team or someone else’s.

You will let me know when there is a fire and we will fight them together.

#### Learn from each other: 
It’s important to me that you achieve your personal and professional goals. Let me know how I can help you get to where you want to go.  I will ask you about your goals all the time :). 

I hope to learn from you as much as you’ll learn from me.

#### Give feedback: 
 I’ll try my best to solicit feedback from you, but please feel free to tell me anything that will help me work better with you.  Feel free to tell me anything that will help me become a better manager.  Feedback is a gift so please don't hold back.

# Your career development
Your career is yours. You know best where you’d like to grow. I can provide feedback and be your mentor, coach and soundboard. I’ll do my best to provide you with growth and learning opportunities, but it’ll be up to you to seize them. 


My view on career development is not to prepare you for your career at a specific company but for you to become the best version of the vision you see for yourself.  This includes having a holistic view that includes not only a caeer but also how your personal goals align with that.  So be prepared for me to ask you questions

# Feedback ground rules
#### Face to face: 
Feedback in text form can easily be misinterpreted. I prefer face-to-face conversations. If we can’t be in person, let’s opt for a video call.

#### Positive intent: 
The best feedback comes from a place of wanting to help the other person grow and be better.

#### Productive: 
Try to make feedback specific to a task or behavior, and not personal. As engineers the more data the better.

#### Early and often: 
Review cycles shouldn’t be the only time we hear feedback from each other. I’ll do my best to provide you feedback early and often, and I expect that you do the same with me.

Feedback will be given in a private setting in almost all scenarios.  

Feedback will be followed up in our 1:1s to discuss further and strategize on what to do with the feedback if necessary.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Effective 1:1’s
The 1:1 is your time primarily and secondarily for me. Length, frequency, format and content is up to you. We’ll start with an hour weekly and adjust from there. 

It won't be a status meeting. You can discuss your top wins, challenges, priorities and how I can help you do amazing work.  Most importantly we will talk about your goals and plan out the opportunties to work towards accomplishing them.
